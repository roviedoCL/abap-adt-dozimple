**AI that works on your SAP system with the rules of a senior consultant.**

An [MCP](https://modelcontextprotocol.io) server by **[DoZimple](https://dozimple.cl)** that gives AI agents —
Claude Code, Kiro or any MCP client — secure, verifiable access to SAP ABAP systems: review code and transport
requests, run ATC and ABAP Unit, diagnose incidents, query the official documentation and, where authorized, save
changes in the right transport after a human confirms them.

## What you can ask

> “What does transport DEVK900123 really change, and which objects usually travel with it but are missing?”
>
> “Run ATC on ZDEMO_REPORT, explain the P1 findings with their SAP note and propose the fix SAP offers.”
>
> “Can I use `COND` on this 7.50 system? If not, rewrite the method with compatible syntax and validate it against SAP.”
>
> “Last night's billing job failed: dumps, job log and application log, and tell me the probable cause.”
>
> “Is this release of four transports ready for production? Explain it in business terms for the PMO.”

The agent picks the tools, chains them and answers with evidence. Every answer states which system it comes from,
and **a failure is never presented as an empty result or as success**.

## Why it is different

| | Usual approach | **abap-adt-doZimple** |
|---|---|---|
| Systems | One per instance, no roles | Every system in the landscape, with a policy per role: DEV / QAS / PRD |
| Writes | Saves wherever SAP decides, or cannot write at all | Development only, explicit transport, preview and human confirmation; stops on another transport's CTS lock |
| Verification | abaplint or nothing | SAP's real syntax check, also on code not saved yet |
| Parameters | A misspelled parameter is silently ignored and the call runs anyway | **Unknown parameters are rejected with the list of accepted ones**: a misspelled `transprot` never runs without the transport you meant |
| Results on failure | Empty lists or misleading “OK” | Typed error saying what could not be checked and why |
| Releases | Hard-coded endpoints | Capabilities read from each system's ADT discovery |
| IDE | Often requires the IDE open | Standalone server, no IDE |
| Third parties | Dependencies mixed with credentials | Components isolated in their own process and filtered |
| Data | Whatever the SAP user can read goes to the model | Security and HR tables blocked (also through views and CDS); personal data masked on production-data systems |

## Guided flows

<!-- prompts:start -->
They show up as commands in the MCP client (in Claude Code: `/mcp__abap-adt-doZimple__<name>`) and chain the tools
with the working rules of a senior consultant.

| Flow | What it does | Chain |
|---|---|---|
| `revisar_pase` — Review a transport before release | Full review of a transport: code, missing companions, locks and, with the risk module, its analysis. | transport_contents → transport_diff → inactive_objects → co_change + edit_preflight → analyze_transport_risk (if module) → three-layer report: business, consultant, Basis |
| `remediar_atc` — Remediate ATC findings of an object | ATC → documentation and SAP note → released successor → fix → syntax → save in the transport. | edit_preflight → run_atc (BEFORE) → explain + api_release_state + where_used/object_versions → CHANGE/INVESTIGATE/KEEP classification → atc_quickfix → syntax_check → write_source in the transport (with human OK) → run_atc (AFTER) and P1 reduction |
| `diagnosticar_ticket` — Diagnose an incident | Dumps, jobs, application log and Gateway errors around an incident. | dumps → jobs → application_log → gateway_errors → transaction_info / get_source / object_versions / transport_contents → probable cause with evidence and what could not be checked |
<!-- prompts:end -->

## DoZimple Transport Risk

The most valuable module for operations: **before releasing, it tells whether a transport or a whole release can go
to QA or production, and why not**, in three layers — a business verdict for the PMO, what to review for the
consultant, and release actions for Basis.

- **Whole releases, not single transports:** what travels in one transport covers the others; it computes the import
  sequence and detects mutual dependencies and collisions between transports.
- **What breaks silently:** positional access to structures that change, code and dictionary dependencies that don't
  travel and don't exist on the target, version drift.
- **The real state of the landscape:** target import queue, CTS locks, transports of copies that drag other people's
  changes, import health and the objects that fail most.
- **Evidence for change management audits.**

It works on any ABAP stack with CTS (ECC and S/4HANA) and is read-only on every system. It requires a **proprietary
DoZimple SAP component** (ICF service in development and read-only RFCs on the targets), which is not distributed in
this repository.

**Want it in your landscape? → [dozimple.cl](https://dozimple.cl)**

## Security

Designed to pass a Security and Basis review without exceptions. Details: **[SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md)** and the
**[threat model](docs/THREAT_MODEL.md)** (STRIDE and OWASP Top 10 for LLM applications).

- **No network surface:** stdio only; no ports are opened.
- **Credentials in the OS keychain** (macOS Keychain or Linux Secret Service), never in files, logs or responses.
- **Policy per role:** QA and production are never written; development only with explicit authorization.
- **Strict parameters:** an unknown or misspelled parameter is an error listing the accepted ones, never silently ignored.
- **No write without human confirmation:** a preview with SAP's syntax check and the real diff, confirmed through MCP
  elicitation or a single-use token bound to those exact arguments.
- **Hash-chained audit log** of every write and execution, fail-closed (no log, no write), verifiable with
  `npm run audit:verify`.
- **SAP credential material and HR data blocked** in SQL queries, also through views and CDS, even if the SAP user is
  authorized. Validated against a real S/4HANA 2023 system, where standard views and CDS read USR02 without naming it.
- **Personal data masked and row caps** on systems with production data.
- **No customer data to the internet:** online documentation search is off by default and, when enabled, every query
  with objects, transports, systems, users or customer names is blocked.
- **Third parties isolated** in their own process with a minimal environment.
- **Controlled supply chain:** 4 production dependencies pinned to exact versions, no install scripts, verified
  registry signatures, CycloneDX SBOM, audit and secret scanning on every commit and in CI.

## Compatibility

| | |
|---|---|
| SAP | ECC 6.0 / NetWeaver 7.50 and later, and S/4HANA on-premise or private cloud, through ADT (`/sap/bc/adt`). Tested live on S/4HANA 2023 (SAP_BASIS 7.58) and ECC 6.0 EHP8 (SAP_BASIS 7.50). Release-dependent features (e.g. API release state) are detected per system |
| MCP clients | Claude Code, Kiro and any MCP client over stdio |
| Platform | Node.js 22+. Credentials in the macOS Keychain, the Linux Secret Service or environment variables |

## Installation

### From npm (recommended)

Pinned to an exact version, without install scripts, like the project's own dependencies:

```sh
npm install -g --ignore-scripts @dozimple/abap-adt@1.1.0
PKG="$(npm root -g)/@dozimple/abap-adt"
mkdir -p ~/.config/abap-adt-dozimple && chmod 700 ~/.config/abap-adt-dozimple
cp "$PKG/config/systems.example.json" ~/.config/abap-adt-dozimple/systems.json   # systems, roles and permissions
chmod 600 ~/.config/abap-adt-dozimple/systems.json
sh "$PKG/scripts/set-password.sh" MY_DEV                                        # prompts; stored in the keychain
node "$PKG/dist/scripts/smoke.js" MY_DEV                                        # read-only validation
```

MCP client registration:

```json
{ "mcpServers": { "abap-adt-doZimple": { "command": "abap-adt-dozimple" } } }
```

Every release is published from CI with [npm provenance](https://docs.npmjs.com/generating-provenance-statements):
`npm view @dozimple/abap-adt@1.1.0 dist.attestations` shows the attestation, and the GitHub release carries the
tarball, its Sigstore bundle (`.sigstore.json`), the same bundle as in-toto provenance (`.intoto.jsonl`) and the
SBOM. To check it: `gh attestation verify dozimple-abap-adt-1.1.0.tgz --repo <owner>/abap-adt-dozimple`.

### From source

```sh
npm ci && npm run build
mkdir -p ~/.config/abap-adt-dozimple
cp config/systems.example.json ~/.config/abap-adt-dozimple/systems.json   # systems, roles and permissions (chmod 600)
scripts/set-password.sh MY_DEV                                           # prompts for the password; stored in the keychain
npm run smoke -- MY_DEV                                                  # read-only validation
```

MCP client registration:

```json
{ "mcpServers": { "abap-adt-doZimple": { "command": "node", "args": ["/path/to/abap-adt-doZimple/dist/index.js"] } } }
```

**SAP documentation** group (optional): install [mcp-sap-docs](https://github.com/marianfoo/mcp-sap-docs)
(Apache-2.0, `abap` variant) in a separate folder and declare how to start it in `sidecars.docs` of `systems.json`
(see `config/systems.example.json`). It runs as an isolated process; online search stays off unless `allowOnline`.

See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). To contribute or extend: `git config core.hooksPath .githooks` (secret and customer-data scanner before every commit)
and the [`nueva-tool`](.claude/skills/nueva-tool/SKILL.md) guide — adding a tool means adding one file. Code comments
and tool descriptions are in Spanish; contributions in English are welcome.

## Credits
