  abap_lint: "**abaplint on a snippet.** Runs abaplint locally (code never leaves the machine) on an ABAP snippet or source.",
  docs_community_search: "**Search SAP Community.** Searches SAP Community (blogs and questions) by error message, class or concept.",
  write_source: "**Save source to SAP.** Replaces the FULL source of an existing object (or class include) in the given transport, after a preview with syntax check and diff and a human confirmation.",
  revert_source: "**Revert to an earlier version.** Writes back an earlier version of an object (the last active one, the one before it, or a numbered one from object_versions) through the same preview, fingerprint, lock and transport as write_source; never reverts on its own.",
  activate: "**Activate object.** Activates an object and returns SAP's messages as they are (errors with line, warnings, objects left inactive).",

  create_transport: "**Create transport request.** Creates a workbench request for an object's package BEFORE the first edit, so the change lands in the ticket's transport and not in a reused task.",
  analyze_transport_risk: "**Transport risk.** Tells whether a transport (or a release of several, comma-separated) is safe to move to QA or production: unreleased tasks, import status, dependencies that don't travel, positional access, CTS locks, import queue.",

  failure_ranking: "**Objects that fail most on import.** Ranking of objects by import failure history in a target.",
